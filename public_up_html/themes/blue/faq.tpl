					<b>What is this bittorrent all about anyway? How do I get the files?</b><br />
					Check out <a href="/out.php?url=http://www.btfaq.com/" class="g_bllink">Brian's BitTorrent FAQ and Guide.</a><br /><br />
						A client that we highly reccomend you to use is <a href="/out.php?url=http://www.utorrent.com/" class="g_bllink">&micro;Torrent</a>.<br /><a name="site2"></a><br />

					<b>Where does the donated money go?</b><br />
					SceneTorrents.org is situated on several dedicated servers. Our monthly running costs are around &euro;2000.
						For an itemised explanation of this please go <a href="/forums_viewtopic.php?id=11395" class="g_bllink">here</a>.
				</div>
				<div class="main_section_bottom"><a name="user"></a>&nbsp;</div>


				<div class="main_section_top"><b>User Information</b><a name="user1"></a></div>
				<div class="main_section_body g_alignleft">
					<b>I registered an account but did not receive the confirmation e-mail!</b><br />
					Some e-mail services, such as hotmail and yahoo, block the confirmation e-mail as spam. If your invitee didn't receive the e-mail the first time,
						it will probably not succeed the second time either. If the account is not confirmed within 5 days then you will receive your invite back.
						If this occurs, it is recommended to try a different e-mail address.<br /><a name="user2"></a><br />

					<b>I've lost my user name or password! Can you send it to me?</b><br />
					Please PM a <a href="/staff.php" class="g_bllink">Global Moderator</a> to do this for you, giving a brief reason why.<br /><a name="user3"></a><br />

					<b>Can you rename my account?</b><br />
					No, we do not rename accounts, sorry.<br /><a name="user4"></a><br />

					<b>Can you delete my (confirmed) account?</b><br />
					Again, PM a <a href="staff.php" class="g_bllink">Global Moderator</a> to do this, giving a brief reason why.(We want to know if we've done something wrong!)<br /><a name="user5"></a><br />

					<b>What is MY ratio?</b><br /><br />
					Your ratio is displayed at the top of all pages in your userbar, as seen here:<br />
						<img src="{THEME_PIC_DIR}ratio.png" alt="ratio" /><br /><br />
						It's important to distinguish between your overall ratio and the individual ratio on each torrent you may be seeding or leeching. The overall ratio takes
						into account the total uploaded and downloaded from your account since you joined the site. The individual ratio takes into account those values for each torrent.<br /><br />

					You may see two symbols instead of a number:<br />
						<ul>
							<li>"Inf.", which is just an abbreviation for Infinity, and means that you have downloaded 0 bytes while uploading a non-zero amount (ul/dl becomes infinity);</li>
							<li> "---", which should be read as "non-available", and shows up when you have both downloaded and uploaded 0 bytes (ul/dl = 0/0 which is an indeterminate amount).</li>
						</ul>
					<a name="user6"></a><br />

					<b>Why is my IP displayed on my details page?</b><br />
					Only you and the site moderators can view your IP address and email. Regular users do not see that information.<br /><a name="user7"></a><br />

					<b>Why can't I login?</b><br />
					This problem sometimes occurs with MSIE. Close all Internet Explorer windows and open Internet Options in the control panel. Click the Delete Cookies button.
						You should now be able to login. Sometimes trying https:// instead of http:// also works. However, if you receive a white page (often ending in takelogin.php)
						it may mean you have been temporarily IP banned for attempting to use an incorrect password too many times. This should disappear within 24hrs, but if you need
						to access the site urgently, join the #sct.support channel on IRC.<br /><a name="user8"></a><br />

					<b>My IP address is dynamic. How do I stay logged in?</b><br />
					You do not have to anymore. Torrent sessions now use a unique passkey, even if the IP changes mid-session, the seeding or leeching will continue and the statistics
						will update without any problem.<br /><a name="user9"></a><br />

					<b>Why am i listed as &quot;unconnectable&quot;? (And why should I care?)</b><br />
					The tracker has determined that you are firewalled or NATed and cannot accept incoming connections.<br /><br />

					This means that other peers in the swarm won't be able to connect to you, yet you will be able to connect to them. Even worse, if two peers are both in this state,
						they will not be able to connect at all. This has obviously a detrimental effect on the overall speed.<br /><br />

					The way to solve the problem involves opening the ports used for incoming connections (the same range you defined in your client) on the firewall and/or configuring
						your NAT server to use a basic form of NAT for that range instead of NAPT (the actual process differs widely between different router models. Check your router documentation
						and/or support forum. You will also find lots of information on the subject at <a href="/out.php?url=http://www.portforward.com/" class="g_bllink">PortForward</a>).
						For an easy to follow guide with step-by-step instructions and screenshots please see <a href="/forums_viewtopic.php?id=2251" class="g_bllink">this guide</a> in our
						very own forums.<br /><a name="usera"></a><br />

					<b>Why can't my friend become a member?</b><br />
					There is a limit of 20000 users. When that number is reached we stop accepting new members. <b>Accounts inactive for more than 42 days are automatically deleted,
						so keep trying. (There is no reservation or queuing system, don't ask for that.)</b>

				<div class="main_section_top">Stats<a name="stats1"></a></div>
				<div class="main_section_body g_alignleft">
					<b>Most common reason for stats not updating</b><br />
					<ul>
						<li>The user is cheating. (a.k.a. "Summary Ban")</li>
						<li>The server is overloaded and unresponsive. Just try to keep the session open until the server responds again. (Flooding the server with consecutive manual updates is not recommended.)</li>
						<li>You are using a faulty client. If you want to use an experimental or CVS version, you do it at your own risk.</li>
					</ul>
					<a name="stats2"></a><br />

					<b>Best practices</b><br />
					<ul>
						<li>If a torrent you are currently leeching/seeding is not listed on your profile, just wait or force a manual update.</li>
						<li>Make sure you exit your client properly, so that the tracker receives "event=completed".</li>
						<li>If the tracker is down, do not stop seeding. As long as the tracker is back up before you exit the client, the stats should update properly.</li>
					</ul>
					<a name="stats3"></a><br />

					<b>May I use any bittorrent client?</b><br />
					<b>No.</b> BitComet is <b>banned</b> (along with anything based on BitComet source code)<br/>
					The following are frowned upon:<br />
					<ul>
						<li>BitTorrent++</li>
						<li>Nova Torrent</li>
						<li>TorrentStorm</li>
						<li>ABC</li>
					</ul>
					These clients do not report correctly to the tracker when canceling/finishing a torrent session. If you use them then a few MB may not be counted towards the stats near the end,
						and torrents may still be listed in your profile for some time after you have closed the client.<br /><br />

					Also, clients in alpha or beta version should be avoided.<br /><br />

					We strongly recommend you use <a href="/out.php?url=www.utorrent.com" class="g_bllink">&micro;Torrent</a>. Please ensure you use the latest version.
						(v1.7 and below are banned.)<br /><a name="stats4"></a><br />

					<b>Why is a torrent I'm leeching/seeding listed several times in my profile?</b><br />
					If for some reason (e.g. PC crash, or frozen client) your client exits improperly and you restart it, it will have a new peer_id, so it will show as a new torrent.
						The old one will never receive a "event=completed" or "event=stopped" and will be listed until some tracker timeout. Just ignore it, it will eventually go away.<br /><a name="stats5"></a><br />

					<b>I've finished or cancelled a torrent. Why is it still listed in my profile?</b><br />
						Some clients, notably TorrentStorm and Nova Torrent, do not report properly to the tracker when canceling or finishing a torrent. In that case, the tracker will keep waiting
						for some message - and thus listing the torrent as seeding or leeching - until some timeout occurs. Just ignore it, it will eventually go away.<br /><a name="stats6"></a><br />

					<b>Multiple IPs (Can I login from different computers?)</b><br />
						Yes. A torrent is associated with the user when it starts via a passkey, so there will be no issues with torrents not working because of different IPs.<br />
						However, please bear in mind there is a limit of 5 concurrent IPs per user.<br /><a name="stats7"></a><br />

					<b>How does NAT/ICS change the picture?</b><br />
					Besides possibly causing you to become &quot;unconnectable&quot;, it doesn't; torrent sessions are identified by a passkey, not by IP address.

					<b>Why can't I upload torrents?</b><br />
					Only specially authorized users <span class="g_c_upldr">(Uploaders)</span> have permission to upload torrents.<br /><a name="uploading2"></a><br />

					<b>What criteria must I meet before I can join the Uploader team?</b><br />
					You must meet the following criteria:<br />
					<ul>
						<li>be able to include a proper NFO,</li>
						<li>have the ability to seed for at least 24 hours,</li>
						<li>have at least 50MBit upload bandwidth,</li>

					<b>Can I upload your torrents to other trackers?</b><br /><br />
					No. We are a closed, limited-membership community. Uploading our torrents elsewhere (whether it be the .torrent file itself, or if you make a new torrent from the
						data files) is against the rules and will usually end in a ban.<br /><br />

					Complaints from other sites' administrative staff about our torrents being posted on their sites will likely result in the banning of the users responsible.

					<b>How do I use the files I've downloaded?</b><br />
					Check out <a href="/formats.php" class="g_bllink">this guide</a>.<br /><a name="downloading2"></a><br />

					<b>Why did an active torrent suddenly disappear?</b><br />
					There may be three reasons for this:
					<ol>
						<li>The torrent may have been out-of-sync with the site rules.</li>
						<li>The uploader may have deleted it because it was a bad release. A replacement will probably be uploaded to take its place.</li>
						<li>A Staff member may have removed it for various reasons.</li>
					</ol>
					Any torrent removed from the site should appear in the Log with the relevant reason.<br /><a name="downloading3"></a><br />

					<b>How do I resume a broken download or reseed something?</b><br />
					Open the .torrent file. When your client asks you for a location, choose the location of the existing file(s) and it will resume/reseed the torrent.<br /><a name="downloading4"></a><br />

					<b>Why do my downloads sometimes stall at 99%?</b><br />
					The more pieces you have, the harder it becomes to find peers who have pieces you are missing. That is why downloads sometimes slow down or even stall when there are just a few
						percent remaining. Just be patient and you will, sooner or later, get the remaining pieces.<br /><a name="downloading5"></a><br />

					<b>What are these "a piece has failed an hash check" messages?</b><br />
					BitTorrent clients check the data they receive for integrity. When a piece fails this check, it is automatically re-downloaded. Occasional hash fails are a common occurrence,
						and you shouldn't worry.<br /><br />

					Some clients have an (advanced) option/preference to 'kick/ban clients that send you bad data' or similar. It should be turned on, since it makes sure that if a peer repeatedly
						sends you pieces that fail the hash check it will be ignored in the future.<br /><a name="downloading6"></a><br />

					<b>The torrent is supposed to be 100MB. How come I downloaded 120MB?</b><br />
					See the hash fails question. If your client receives bad data it will have to redownload it, therefore the total downloaded may be larger than the torrent size. Make sure the
						"kick/ban" option is turned on to minimize the extra downloads.<br /><a name="downloading7"></a><br />

					<b>Why do I get a "rejected by tracker - Port xxxx is blacklisted" error?</b><br />
					Your client is reporting to the tracker that it uses one of the default bittorrent ports (6881-6889) or any other common p2p port for incoming connections.<br /><br />

					SceneTorrents does not allow clients to use ports commonly associated with p2p protocols. The reason for this is that it is a common practice for ISPs to throttle those ports
						(that is, limit the bandwidth, hence the speed).<br /><br />

					The blocked ports list include, but is not neccessarily limited to, the following:<br />
					<ul>
						<li>Direct Connect (411 - 413)</li>
						<li>Kazaa (1214)</li>
						<li>eDonkey (4662)</li>
						<li>Gnutella (6346 - 6347)</li>
						<li>BitTorrent (6881 - 6889)</li>
					</ul>
					In order to use use our tracker, you must configure your client to use any port range that does not contain those ports (a range within the region 49152 through 65535 is preferable).
						Notice that some clients, like Azureus 2.0.7.0 or higher, use a single port for all torrents, while most others use one port per open torrent. The size of the range you choose
						should take this into account (typically less than 10 ports wide. There is no benefit whatsoever in choosing a wide range, and there are possible security implications).<br /><br />

					These ports are used for connections between peers, not client to tracker. Therefore this change will not interfere with your ability to use other trackers (in fact it should
						increase your speed with torrents from any tracker, not just ours). Your client will also still be able to connect to peers that are using the standard ports. If your client
						does not allow custom ports to be used, you will have to switch to one that does.<br /><br />

					Do not ask us, or in the forums, which ports you should choose. The more random the choice is the harder it will be for ISPs to catch on to us and start limiting speeds on the
						ports we use. If we simply define another range ISPs will start throttling that range also.<br /><br />

					Finally, remember to forward the chosen ports in your router and/or open them in your firewall, should you have them. See the 
						<a href="#user8" class="g_bllink">Why am i listed as &quot;unconnectable&quot;?</a> section and links therein for more information on this.<br /><a name="downloading8"></a><br />

					<b>What's this "IOError - [Errno13] Permission denied" error?</b><br />
					If you just want to fix it, reboot your computer, it should solve the problem. Otherwise read on.<br /><br />

					IOError means Input-Output Error, and that is a file system error, not a tracker one. It shows up when your client is, for some reason, unable to open the partially downloaded
						torrent files. The most common cause is two instances of the client to be running simultaneously: the last time the client was closed it somehow didn't really close but kept
						running in the background, and is therefore still locking the files, making it impossible for the new instance to open them.<br /><br />

					A more uncommon occurrence is a corrupted FAT. A crash may result in corruption that makes the partially downloaded files unreadable, and the error ensues. Running scandisk should
					solve the problem. (Note that this may happen only if you're running Windows 9x - which only support FAT - or NT/2000/XP with FAT formatted hard drives. NTFS is much more robust and
					should never permit this problem.)

				<div class="main_section_top">Download speeds<a name="improve1"></a></div>
				<div class="main_section_body g_alignleft">
					The download speed mostly depends on the seeder-to-leecher ratio (SLR). Poor download speed is mainly a problem with new and very popular torrents where the SLR is low.<br /><br />

					(Proselytising sidenote: make sure you remember that you did not enjoy the low speed. Seed so that others will not endure the same.)<br /><br />

					<b>Being Connectable</b><br />
					See the <a href="#user8" class="g_bllink">Why am i listed as &quot;unconnectable&quot;?</a> section, or alternatively, go straight to
						<a href="/forums_viewtopic.php?id=2251" class="g_bllink">this guide</a>.<br /><a name="improve2"></a><br />

					<b>Limiting Upload speeds</b><br />
					The upload speed affects the download speed in essentially two ways:<br />
					<ul>
						<li>BitTorrent peers tend to favour those other peers that upload to them. This means that if A and B are leeching the same torrent and A is sending data to B at high speed
							then B will try to reciprocate. So due to this effect high upload speeds lead to high download speeds.</li>
						<li>Due to the way TCP works, when A is downloading something from B, it has to keep telling B that it received the data sent to him. (These are called acknowledgements -
							ACKs -, a sort of "got it!" messages). If A fails to do this then B will stop sending data and wait. If A is uploading at full speed there may be no bandwidth left for
							the ACKs and they will be delayed. So due to this effect excessively high upload speeds lead to low download speeds.</li>
					</ul>
					The full effect is a combination of the two. The upload should be kept as high as possible while allowing the ACKs to get through without delay. A good thumb rule is keeping
						the upload at about 80% of the theoretical upload speed. You will have to fine tune yours to find out what works best for you. (Remember that keeping the upload high has
						the additional benefit of helping with your ratio.)<br /><br />

					If you are running more than one instance of a client, it is the overall upload speed that you must take into account. Some clients (e.g. Azureus) limit global upload speed,
						others (e.g. Shad0w's) do it on a per torrent basis. Know your client. The same applies if you are using your connection for anything else (e.g. browsing or ftp), always
						think of the overall upload speed.<br /><a name="improve3"></a><br />

					<b>Limiting the number of simultaneous connections</b><br />
					Some operating systems (like Windows 9x) do not deal well with a large number of connections, and may even crash. Also some home routers (particularly when running NAT and/or
						firewall with stateful inspection services) tend to become slow or crash when having to deal with too many connections. There are no fixed values for this, you may try 60
						or 100 and experiment with the value. Note that these numbers are additive, if you have two instances of a client running the numbers add up.<br /><a name="improve4"></a><br />

					<b>Limiting the number of simultaneous uploads</b><br />
					Isn't this the same as above? No. Connections limit the number of peers your client is talking to and/or downloading from. Uploads limit the number of peers your client is
						actually uploading to. The ideal number is typically much lower than the number of connections, and highly dependent on your (physical) connection.<br /><a name="improve5"></a><br />

					<b>Giving it some time</b><br />
					As explained above, peers favour other peers that upload to them. When you start leeching a new torrent, you have nothing to offer to other peers and they will tend to ignore you.
						This makes the starts slow, in particular if, by change, the peers you are connected to include few or no seeders. The download speed should increase as soon as you have some
						pieces to share.<br /><a name="improve6"></a><br />

					<b>Why is my browsing so slow while leeching?</b><br />
					Browsing may be slow if you are downloading too fast, most torrent clients have the option to limit your download speed.<br /><br />
					Browsing was used just as an example, the same applies to gaming, IMing, etc.

					<em>Caveat: This is a large and complex topic. It is not possible to cover all variations here.</em><br /><br />

					Short reply: most forced proxies can be bypassed by enabling the SSL site and tracker options on the profile page. Please note that some torrent clients do not support 
						SSL trackers.<br /><br />

					<b>What is a proxy?</b><br />
						Basically a middleman. When you are browsing a site through a proxy, your requests are sent to the proxy and the proxy forwards them to the site instead of you connecting
						directly to the site. There are several classifications (the terminology is far from standard):<br />
					<ul>
						<li>Transparent - A transparent proxy is one that needs no configuration on the clients. It works by automatically redirecting all port 80 traffic to the proxy. (Sometimes
							used as synonym for non-anonymous.)</li>
						<li>Explicit/Voluntary - Clients must configure their browsers to use them.</li>
						<li>Anonymous - The proxy sends no client identification to the server. (HTTP_X_FORWARDED_FOR header is not sent; the server does not see your IP.)</li>
						<li>Highly Anonymous - The proxy sends no client nor proxy identification to the server. (HTTP_X_FORWARDED_FOR, HTTP_VIA and HTTP_PROXY_CONNECTION headers are not sent;
							the server doesn't see your IP and doesn't even know you're using a proxy.)</li>
						<li>Public - Self explanatory</li>
					</ul>
					A transparent proxy may or may not be anonymous, and there are several levels of anonymity.<br /><a name="proxy2"></a><br />

					<b>How do I find out if I'm behind a (transparent/anonymous) proxy?</b><br />
					Try <a href="/out.php?url=http://proxyjudge.org/" class="g_bllink">ProxyJudge</a>. It lists the HTTP headers that the server where it is running received from you.
						The relevant ones are HTTP_CLIENT_IP, HTTP_X_FORWARDED_FOR and REMOTE_ADDR.<br /><a name="proxy3"></a><br />

					<b>Why am i as "unconnectable" even though I'm not NAT/Firewalled?</b><br />
					The SceneTorrents tracker is quite smart at finding your real IP, but it does need the proxy to send the HTTP header HTTP_X_FORWARDED_FOR. If your ISP's proxy does not,
						then what happens is that the tracker will interpret the proxy's IP address as the client's IP address. So when you login and the tracker tries to connect to your client
						to see if you are NAT/firewalled it will actually try to connect to the proxy on the port your client reports to be using for incoming connections. Naturally the proxy
						will not be listening on that port, the connection will fail and the tracker will think you are NAT/firewalled.<br /><a name="proxy4"></a><br />

					<b>Can I bypass my ISP's proxy?</b><br />
					If your ISP only allows HTTP traffic through port 80 or blocks the usual proxy ports then the SSL options on the profile page can usually bypass any proxies.<br /><a name="proxy5"></a><br />

					<b>How do I make my bittorrent client use a proxy?</b><br />
					Each torrent client is different, some use the proxy settings set in Internet Explorer, while others have their own proxy settings. Please read the manual for the torrent
						client you are using or ask in the forums.<br /><a name="proxy6"></a><br />

					<b>Why can't I signup from behind a proxy?</b><br />
					It is our policy not to allow new accounts to be opened from behind a proxy.<br /><a name="proxy7"></a><br />

					<b>Does this apply to other torrent sites?</b><br />
					This section was written for SceneTorrents, a closed, port 80 tracker. Other trackers may be open or closed, and many listen on e.g. ports 6868 or 6969. The above does not necessarily
						apply to other trackers.

					<b>Your ISP blocks the site's address</b><br />
					(In first place, it's unlikely your ISP is doing so. DNS name resolution and/or network problems are the usual culprits.) There's nothing we can do. You should contact your
						ISP (or get a new one). Note that you can still visit the site via a proxy, follow the instructions in the relevant section. In this case it doesn't matter if the proxy
						is anonymous or not, or which port it listens to. Notice that you will always be listed as an "unconnectable" client because the tracker will be unable to check that
