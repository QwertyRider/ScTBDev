				<div class="main_section_body g_alignleft">
					<ul class="rules_ul">
						<li>Do <b>NOT</b> upload our torrents to other trackers! Stealing torrents and uploading the torrents (or the data) elsewhere will result in your account being
							<b>DISABLED</b> and <b>IP banned,</b>. Simply putting the data into a new torrent does not omit you from this rule! Not only will you be disabled but you
							will also be IP banned permanently, so consider the consequences especially if you are sharing a server.(See the <a href="/faq.php#up3" class="g_bblink"><b>FAQ</b></a>
							for details.)</li>
						<li>Do <b>NOT</b> trade our invites or accounts! Public Offers (this includes a forum on a private site) or even 'Giveaways' are also prohibited!
							If/Once found you will receive an immediate ban of your account and the person you invited.</li>
						<li>Do <b>NOT</b> cheat. This involves; ghost leeching, spoofing, use a ratiomaster or a modified client. If you, or anyone on your IP/server is found to be cheating then
							<b>ALL</b> users on that IP will be disabled. Take this into account <b>before</b> you share your server with a stranger, otherwise if they cheat you get banned too!</li>
