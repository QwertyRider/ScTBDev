				<div class="main_section_body g_alignleft">
					Hey guys, here's some info about common files that you can download from the internet, and a little bit about using these
					files for their intended purposes. If you're stuck on what exactly a file is or how to open it maybe your answer lies ahead.
					If you don't find your answer here, then please post in the &quot;Forum&quot;. So without further adieu lets get the show on the road!

				<div class="main_section_top">Compression Files</div>
				<div class="main_section_body g_alignleft">
					<b>.rar .zip .ace .r01 .001</b>	<br />
					These extensions are quite common and mean that your file(s) are compressed into an &quot;archive&quot;.
					This is just a way of making the files more compact and easier to download.<br /><br />

					To open any of those archives listed above you can use <a href="/out.php?url=http://www.rarlab.com/download.htm" class="g_bllink">WinRAR</a>
					(Make sure you have the latest version) or <a href="/out.php?url=http://www.powerarchiver.com/download/" class="g_bllink">PowerArchiver</a>.<br /><br />

					If the two first mentioned programs aren't working for you and you have a .ace or .001 file you can try
					<a href="/out.php?url=http://www.winace.com/" class="g_bllink">Winace</a> (Trial version).<br /><br />

					<b>.cbr .cbz</b><br />
					These are usually comic books in an archive format. a .cbr file is actually the same thing as a .rar file and a .cbz file is the
					same as a .zip file. However, often when opening them with WinRAR or WinZip it will disorder your pages. To display these archives
					properly it's often best to use <a href="/out.php?url=http://www.geocities.com/davidayton/CDisplay" class="g_bllink">CDisplay</a>.

				<div class="main_section_top">Multimedia Files</div>
				<div class="main_section_body g_alignleft">
					<b>.avi .mpg. .mpeg .divx .xvid .wmv</b><br />
					These files are usually movies or TVshows, or a host of other types of media. They can be viewed using various media players,
					but I suggest using <a href="/out.php?url=http://www.inmatrix.com/files/zoomplayer_download.shtml" class="g_bllink">Zoomplayer</a>,
					<a href="/out.php?url=http://www.bsplayer.org/" class="g_bllink">BSPlayer</a>,
					<a href="/out.php?url=http://www.videolan.org/vlc/" class="g_bllink">VLC media player</a> or 
					<a href="/out.php?url=http://www.microsoft.com/windows/windowsmedia/default.aspx" class="g_bllink">Windows Media Player</a>.
					 Also, you'll need to make sure you have the right codecs to play each individual file. Codecs are a tricky business sometimes
					so to help you out with your file and what exact codecs it needs try using 
					<a href="/out.php?url=http://www.headbands.com/gspot/download.html" class="g_bllink">GSpot</a>.
					It tells you what codecs you need. Then just look on the net to find them, below are some common codecs and their download links

					<b>.bin and .cue</b><br />
					These are your standard images of a CD, and are used quite alot these days. To open them you have a couple options. You can burn them using
					<a href="/out.php?url=http://www.nero.com" class="g_bllink">Nero</a> (Trial Version) or
					<a href="/out.php?url=http://www.alcohol-software.com/" class="g_bllink">Alcohol 120%</a>, but this proves to be soooooooo problematic for a lot
					of people. You should also consult this tutorial for burning images with various software programs You can also use
					<a href="/out.php?url=http://www.daemon-tools.cc/portal/portal.php" class="g_bllink">Daemon Tools</a>, which lets you mount the image to a
					&quot;virtual cd-rom&quot;, so basically it tricks your computer into thinking that you have another cd-rom and that you're putting a cd with your
					image file on it into this virtual cd-rom, it's great cuz you'll never make a bad cd again, Alcohol 120% also sports a virtual cd-rom feature.
					Finally, if you're still struggling to access the files contained within any given image file you can use
					<a href="/out.php?url=http://cdmage.cjb.net/" class="g_bllink">CDMage</a> to extract the files and then burn them, or just access them from your
					hard drive. You can also use <a href="/out.php?url=http://www.vcdgear.com/" class="g_bllink">VCDGear</a> to extract the mpeg contents of a SVCD
					or VCD image file such as bin/cue.<br /><br />

					<b>.iso</b><br />
					Another type of image file that follows similar rules as .bin and .cue. You can mount it with most virtual-drive managers. Sometimes converting
					a problematic .bin and .cue file to an .iso can help you burn it to a cd.<br /><br />

					<b>.ccd .img .sub</b><br />
					All these files go together and are in the <a href="/out.php?url=http://www.slysoft.com/en/clonecd.html" class="g_bllink">CloneCD</a> format.
					CloneCD is like most other CD-Burning programs, see the .bin and .cue section if you're having problems with these files. However, you can also
					mount most of these files with a virtual-drive manager.
