				<div class="main_section_top">Downloaded a movie and don't know what CAM/TS/TC/SCR means?</div>
				<div class="main_section_body g_alignleft">
					<b>CAM</b><br />
					A cam is a theater rip usually done with a digital video camera. A mini tripod is sometimes used, but a lot of the time this wont be
					possible, so the camera may shake. Also seating placement isn't always idle, and it might be filmed from an angle. If cropped properly,
					this is hard to tell unless there's text on the screen, but a lot of times these are left with triangular borders on the top and bottom
					of the screen. Sound is taken from the onboard microphone of the camera, and especially in comedies, laughter can often be heard during
					the film. Due to these factors picture and sound quality are usually quite poor, but sometimes we're lucky, and the theater will be
					fairly empty and a fairly clear signal will be heard.<br /><br />

					<b>TELESYNC (TS)</b><br />
					A telesync is the same spec as a CAM except it uses an external audio source (most likely an audio jack in the chair for hard of hearing
					people). A direct audio source does not ensure a good quality audio source, as a lot of background noise can interfere. A lot of the times
					a telesync is filmed in an empty cinema or from the projection booth with a professional camera, giving a better picture quality. Quality
					ranges drastically, check the sample before downloading the full release. A high percentage of Telesyncs are CAMs that have been
					mislabeled.<br /><br />

					<b>WORKPRINT (WP)</b><br />
					A workprint is a copy of the film that has not been finished. It can be missing scenes, music, and quality can range from excellent to
					very poor. Some WPs are very different from the final print (Men In Black is missing all the aliens, and has actors in their places) and
					others can contain extra scenes (Jay and Silent Bob) . WPs can be nice additions to the collection once a good quality final has been
					obtained.<br /><br />

					<b>Asian Silvers / PDVD</b><br />
					These are films put out by eastern bootleggers, and these are usually bought by some groups to put out as their own. Silvers are very cheap
					and easily available in a lot of countries, and its easy to put out a release, which is why there are so many in the scene at the moment,
					mainly from smaller groups who don't last more than a few releases. PDVDs are the same thing pressed onto a DVD. They have removable subtitles,
					and the quality is usually better than the silvers. These are ripped like a normal DVD, but usually released as VCD.<br /><br />

					<b>TELECINE (TC)</b><br />
					A telecine machine copies the film digitally from the reels. Sound and picture should be very good, but due to the equipment involved and
					cost telecines are fairly uncommon. Generally the film will be in correct aspect ratio, although 4:3 telecines have existed. A great
					example is the JURASSIC PARK 3 TC done last year. TC should not be confused with TimeCode , which is a visible counter on screen
					throughout the film.<br /><br />

					<b>REGION 5 (R5 / R5-Line)</b><br />
					An R5 is a warez release, made with a telecine machine from an analog source. Unlike a TC, the digitization is performed by the studio
					itself with very professional (and expensive) equipment and usually from the original source. The purpose of it is to create a high
					quality digital copy (usually for a later DVD release). But unlike a DVD, an R5 is released before the digital post-processing is
					finished. The quality of the rips can differ, but an R5 can be almost indistinguishable from a DVDRip since many movies are published
					on DVD with minimal editing.<br />
					The name R5 refers to DVD Region 5, which includes the former Soviet Union, the Indian subcontinent, and much of Africa. In an effort
					to compete with movie piracy in these areas, the movie industry chose to create a new format for DVD releases that could be produced
					more quickly and less expensively than traditional DVD releases. R5 releases differ from normal releases in that they lack both the
					image post-processing and special features that are common on DVD releases. This allows the film to be released for sale at the same
					time that DVD Screeners are released. Since DVD Screeners are the chief source of high-quality pre-DVD release pirated movies
					(in comparison to cam or telesync, mostly), this allows the movie studios to beat the pirates to market.<br /><br />

					<b>SCREENER (SCR)</b><br />
					A pre VHS tape, sent to rental stores, and various other places for promotional use. A screener is supplied on a VHS tape, and is usually
					in a 4:3 (full screen) a/r, although letterboxed screeners are sometimes found. The main draw back is a "ticker" (a message that scrolls
					past at the bottom of the screen, with the copyright and anti-copy telephone number). Also, if the tape contains any serial numbers, or
					any other markings that could lead to the source of the tape, these will have to be blocked, usually with a black mark over the section.
					This is sometimes only for a few seconds, but unfortunately on some copies this will last for the entire film, and some can be quite big.
					Depending on the equipment used, screener quality can range from excellent if done from a MASTER copy, to very poor if done on an old VHS
					recorder thru poor capture equipment on a copied tape. Most screeners are transferred to VCD, but a few attempts at SVCD have occurred,
					some looking better than others.<br /><br />

					<b>DVD-SCREENER (DVDscr)</b><br />
					Same premise as a screener, but transferred off a DVD. Usually letterbox, but without the extras that a DVD retail would contain. The
					ticker is not usually in the black bars, and will disrupt the viewing. If the ripper has any skill, a DVDscr should be very good.
					Usually transferred to SVCD or DivX/XviD.<br /><br />

					<b>VHSRip</b><br />
					Transferred off a retail VHS, mainly skating/sports videos and XXX releases.<br /><br />

					<b>DVDRip</b><br />
					A copy of the final released DVD. If possible this is released PRE retail (for example, Star Wars episode 2) again, should be excellent
					quality. DVDrips are released in SVCD and DivX/XviD.<br /><br />

					<b>DVDR</b><br />
					This is the retail copy of the movie and if you want the best quality, then this is the download for you, it will have the best picture
					and sound quality and their will be subs with this release also.<br /><br />

					<b>Blu-Ray</b><br />
					Blu-Ray is the new standard in quality and usually appear a few days after the DVDRips of the movie, if you have a tv that can play HD
					and the ratio that can take the hit, grab these!

				<div class="main_section_body g_alignleft">
					<b>DSRip</b><br />
					 DSRip stands for Digital Satellite Rip and this the lowest quality tv encode/rip.<br /><br />

					<b>PDTV</b><br />
					PDTV is an abbreviation short for Pure Digital Television. Often seen as part of the filename of TV shows shared through P2P systems on the
					Internet. In this case, PDTV refers not to container, bitrate or dimensions of the video, but the digital nature of the capture source.
					Alternately European rippers often use the label DVBRip or DVB-rip to specify a purely digital rip of a DVB broadcast.<br />
					PDTV encompasses a broad array of capture methods and sources, but generally it involves the capture of SD or non-HD digital television
					broadcasts without any analog-to-digital conversion, instead relying on directly ripping MPEG streams. PDTV sources can be captured by a
					variety of digital TV tuner cards from a digital feed such as ClearQAM unencrypted cable, Digital Terrestrial Television, Digital Video
					Broadcast or other satellite sources. Just as with Freeview (DVB-T) in the United Kingdom, broadcast television in the United States has
					no barriers to PDTV capture. Hardware such as the HDHomeRun when connected to an ATSC (Antenna) or unencrypted ClearQAM cable feed allows
					lossless digital capture of MPEG-2 streams (Pure Digital Television), without monthly fees or other restrictions normally implemented by a
					Set-top box. Although different from the analog hole, Pure Digital Television capture imposes no technological restriction on what is done
					with the stream; playback, Mash-Ups and even recompression/pirated distribution are possible without the permission of the rights holder.<br /><br />

					<b>HDTV</b><br />
					HDTV-Rip is a method of copying video that involves recording television shows or movies broadcast in high definition quality, often with
					5.1 surround sound. The recording can either be done directly through a PC video capture device, or via a networked digital video recorder
					box. Either during or after recording, the video may be compressed using a variety of codecs, such as MPEG-4. An HDTV-Rip, however, does
					not need to be HD in its final format. It just needs to be captured from an HD source.<br /><br />

					<b>720p</b><br />
					720p versions of both TV and movies are the for people who want quality.<br /><br />

					<b>1080p</b><br />
					1080p versions of both TV and movies are the for people who have a fast line and a big tv!
				</div>
				<div class="main_section_bottom"></div>

				<div class="main_section_top">Okay so what about formats?</div>
				<div class="main_section_body g_alignleft">
					<b>XviD</b><br />
					XviD's are the most common format for a movie or a tv show, the codec has been used for many years and been pushed to its limits.
					They are usually around 230mb for a 20min tv show, 350mb for a 40min tv show (without the ads ofc), and 700mb for a short movie, but if the
					movie is longer then the release will come in a 1400mb version.<br /><br />

					<b>x264</b><br />
					The X264 codec is the codec of 2008 and is used for HD content to keep the quality and will become the codec to be used for quality.
					A 20min X264 encoded TV show is around 750mb, and a 40min show is around 1.09GB. For a movie, they will come in at 4.7 for a smaller movie,
					and for the longer movies you can see from 8GB to 12GB.

				<div class="main_section_top">Scene Tags</div>
				<div class="main_section_body g_alignleft">
					<b>PROPER</b><br />
					Due to scene rules, whoever releases the first Telesync has won that race (for example). But if the quality of that release is fairly poor,
					if another group has another telesync (or the same source in higher quality) then the tag PROPER is added to the folder to avoid being duped.
					PROPER is the most subjective tag in the scene, and a lot of people will generally argue whether the PROPER is better than the original release.
					A lot of groups release PROPERS just out of desperation due to losing the race. A reason for the PROPER should always be included in the
					NFO.<br /><br />

					<b>LIMITED</b><br />
					A limited movie means it has had a limited theater run, generally opening in less than 250 theaters, generally smaller films (such as art house
					films) are released as limited.<br /><br />

					<b>INTERNAL</b><br />
					An internal release is done for several reasons. Classic DVD groups do a lot of INTERNAL releases, as they wont be dupe'd on it. Also lower
					quality theater rips are done INTERNAL so not to lower the reputation of the group, or due to the amount of rips done already. An INTERNAL release
					is available as normal on the groups affiliate sites, but they can't be traded to other sites without request from the site ops. Some INTERNAL
					releases still trickle down to IRC/Newsgroups, it usually depends on the title and the popularity. Earlier in the year people referred to Centropy
					going &quot;internal&quot;. This meant the group were only releasing the movies to their members and site ops. This is in a different context to the
					usual definition.<br /><br />

					<b>STV</b><br />
					Straight To Video. Was never released in theaters, and therefore a lot of sites do not allow these.<br /><br />

					<b>ASPECT RATIO TAGS</b><br />
					These are *WS* for widescreen (letterbox) and *FS* for Fullscreen.<br /><br />

					<b>REPACK</b><br />
					If a group releases a bad rip, they will release a Repack which will fix the problems.<br /><br />

					<b>NUKED</b><br />
					A film can be nuked for various reasons. Individual sites will nuke for breaking their rules (such as &quot;No Telesyncs&quot;) but if the film
					has something extremely wrong with it (no soundtrack for 20mins, CD2 is incorrect film/game etc) then a global nuke will occur, and people trading
					it across sites will lose their credits. Nuked films can still reach other sources such as p2p/usenet, but its a good idea to check why it was nuked
					first in case. If a group realise there is something wrong, they can request a nuke.
				</div>
				<div class="main_section_bottom"></div>

				<div class="main_section_top">Nuke Reasons</div>
				<div class="main_section_body g_alignleft">
					This is a list of common reasons a film can be nuked for (generally DVDRip)<br /><br />

					<b>BAD A/R</b><br />
					Bad aspect ratio, ie people appear too fat/thin<br /><br />

					<b>BAD IVTC</b><br />
					Bad inverse telecine. process of converting framerates was incorrect.<br /><br />

					<b>INTERLACED</b><br />
					Black lines on movement as the field order is incorrect.<br /><br />

					<b>DUPE</b><br />
					Dupe is quite simply, if something exists already, then theres no reason for it to exist again without proper reason.<br /><br />

					<b>OOS</b><br />
					OOS means Out Of Sync, this means the video does not match up to the audio, even when its a little out, its very annoying.

				<div class="main_section_top">Other things that you might need to know.</div>
				<div class="main_section_body g_alignleft">
					<b>Watermarks</b><br />
					A lot of films come from Screeners and these are tagged by the movie company, usually with a letter/initials or a
					little logo, generally in one of the corners.<br /><br />

					<b>Black And White</b><br />
					As above, movies that come from Screeners might come with black and white scenes in the move in an effort to stop it from being sold as retail.
