						<li>The most important rule: Use your better judgment!</li>
						<li>Don't be afraid to say <b>NO</b>!</li>
						<li>Don't defy another mod in public, instead send a PM or through IM.</li>
						<li>Be tolerant! Give the users a chance to reform.</li>
						<li>Don't act prematurely, let the users make their mistakes and THEN correct them.</li>
						<li>Try correcting any "off topics" rather than closing a thread.</li>
						<li>Move topics rather than locking them.</li>
						<li>Be tolerant when moderating the Chit-chat section (give them some slack).</li>
						<li>If you lock a topic, give a brief explanation as to why you're locking it.</li>
						<li><b>Always</b> state a reason (in the user comment box) as to why the user is being banned / warned. <b>NUB</b> is not a good enough reason.
							Neither is "HAX" or "CHEAT" or "OOPS" etc....Other members of staff will need to refer to it when dealing with the user should they come to
							#sct.support so provide screenshots, IPs etc.. where necessary!</li>
